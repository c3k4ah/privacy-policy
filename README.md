# 📄 Mobile App Privacy Policies

This repository contains the privacy policies for all mobile applications developed and published by me.

Each privacy policy is tailored to the specific app it supports and outlines how user data is collected, used, and protected.

## 🔒 Purpose

Transparency is a key part of our commitment to user privacy. By making our privacy policies publicly accessible, we aim to:

- Inform users about data collection practices
- Explain how data is stored, used, and protected
- Comply with platform and legal requirements
